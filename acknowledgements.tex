\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank all of the professors of department of Computer Science of Politecnico Di Milano and specially professor Sara Comai for their immense support throughout my career as a student.

I would like to give my special gratitude to professor Piero Fraternali for building a foundation of knowledge without which this project would not have been possible.
